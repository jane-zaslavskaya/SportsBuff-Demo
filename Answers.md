● How long did you spend on the homework test?  
24h  
    
● What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time  
on the assignment, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add  
I think it will be better to make navigation bar on HomeViewController as custom view to get more customization features.  
Generally, improvements almost has no boundaries.   
But it's necessary to understand the feasibility of the time spent in relation to the task, as well as what is in priority for the project.   
    
● Which parts did you spend the most time with?  
I have spend much time on the custom collection view layout. It was really interesting challenge.   
But all 'custom' elements takes a lot of time, so it wasn't a suprise for me :)   
    
● How did you find the test overall? We’d love to hear your suggestions on how we can
improve.  
I do really appreciate that the test allows to check the way the developer handles most common cases.
In my opinion UI design needs to be improved.  
1. It's more user-friendly to move right navigation icons to tab bar. It also takes less time to implement native elements instead of custom complex navigation bar.   
2. Age displaying looks really strange on DetailsViewController. It seems like a button but I can't get this functionality.  
I think it would be better to append age as a part of subtitle text under the user name, so it will be something like "23 yrs, France".
Instead, right view can be used as "Follow/add a friend/etc." action button.  

Also it takes a lot of time to load 5000 photos from the url. It's necessary to add pagination in this case.
